### What is GBCC Tech Company?
- GBCC Tech Company is a club at Great Bay Community College. This club focuses on developing computer-technologies projects, to improve skills in computer technologies and teamwork in project development.  


### What do GBCC Tech Company do?

GBCC Tech Company currently designed to do four activities:

1. **Meet-up**
  -> Meet-up is a mandatory meeting. At the beginning of the meeting we will discuss the state of the club. This is important because, it is where members should work on improving the club. Then, we would discuss club's current projects, future projects, and proposed projects. Finally, we would have an open discussion.  

2. **Workbench**
	-> Workbench is a place or space to work, and collaborate. Ideally, this is where members code, design, or hangout. In addition we should also use this space to work on our school assignments. For instance, if a member have a programming assignment, then a member could do it here. Please learn from each other (but no copying other's work). More importantly, when we're not in Meet-up, we should be able to find our group members here.

3. **Talk**
	-> Talk is a presentation about a skill, or interest, or story. For example, if a member is really good at time management and this member wants to share the tips and tricks on time management, then this member should have a Talk about this particular skill. Another example, a member just mastered how to program the gyroscope in Android and, this member wants to share how it's done, then this member should have a Talk. The main goal of this activity is to learn by teaching and to improve presentation skills.

4. **Celebration**
	-> Celebration is a party. Its goal is to celebrate team members' hard work and have fun. It would be scheduled after a project is completed.
